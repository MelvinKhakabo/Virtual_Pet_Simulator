# Virtual_Pet_Simulator
Virtual Pet Simulator Python Project

##  Project Idea: Virtual Pet Simulator
### Objective:
Create a Python program where users can take care of a virtual pet, ensuring it remains happy, healthy, and fed. The pet's needs will change over time, requiring attention.

### Features:
Create Your Pet:

Allow users to name and choose the type of their pet (e.g., dog, cat, bird).
Pet Stats:

Track the pet's health, happiness, hunger, and energy levels.
Interact with Your Pet:

Feed, play with, or let the pet rest to improve its stats.
Dynamic Changes:

Gradually decrease stats over time if the pet isnâ€™t cared for, leading to consequences like sickness or running away.
Save & Load Progress:

Persist the pet's state between sessions.
