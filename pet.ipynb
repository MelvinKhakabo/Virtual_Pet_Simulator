    "##  Project Idea: Virtual Pet Simulator\n",
    "### Objective\n",
    "Create a Python program where users can take care of a virtual pet, ensuring it remains happy, healthy, and fed. The pet's needs will change over time, requiring attention.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Features\n",
    "#### Create Your Pet\n",
    "Allow users to name and choose the type of their pet (e.g., dog, cat, bird).\n",
    "#### Pet Stats\n",
    "Track the pet's health, happiness, hunger, and energy levels.\n",
    "#### Interact with Your Pet\n",
    "Feed, play with, or let the pet rest to improve its stats.\n",
    "#### Dynamic Changes\n",
    "Gradually decrease stats over time if the pet isnâ€™t cared for, leading to consequences like sickness or running away.\n",
    "#### Save & Load Progress\n",
    "Persist the pet's state between sessions.\n"

    "### How It Works:\n",
    "#### Creating a Pet:\n",
    "Users name their pet and specify its type. Initial stats are set (e.g., hunger, happiness).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Managing Stats:\n",
    "Hunger, happiness, health, and energy decrease over time.\n",
    "Users can interact with the pet to restore its stats.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Interactions:\n",
    "Feed: Increases hunger and slightly improves health.\n",
    "Play: Increases happiness but reduces energy.\n",
    "Rest: Increases energy.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Dynamic Events:\n",
    "Neglecting the pet reduces health and can lead to its \"death.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Save & Load:\n",
    "Pet progress is saved in a JSON file and reloaded on the next session."
